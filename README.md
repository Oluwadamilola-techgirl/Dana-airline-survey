## Introduction
This project is aimed at exhibiting my skills in analysis and visualization of **Dana airline** survey result using power BI.
This is my capstone project after learning Data analytics with Digitaley drive

**_Disclaimer_**: _This dataset or report doesnt represent any company,It is merely to demonstrate capabilities in data analytics_.

## Problem statement
The task is to recommend a data driven strategy to increasing Dana airlineâ€™s satisfaction rate.

## Data sourcing
The link to dataset was in the capstone pdf, downloaded data as excel file then imported to POWER BI for analysis.

## Data Transformation
Data cleaning and transformation was carried with power query. The columns were thoroughly checked out to ensure they were valid and devoid of empty cells and errors. However, I added a new conditional column name **Age group** to group the age of passengers into a range for ease in visualization.

## Data modelling

Here are the insights:
1. The in-flight Wi-Fi service and online booking need to be improved on as they have low average ratings  of 2.73 and 2.76 respectively.
2. A higher percentage of Dana airline passengers are between the ages 41-50.
3. Measures should be put in place to make online booking seamless for passengers.

## Conclusion
Improving Inflight Wi-Fi service and making online booking seamless will improve customers satisfaction for Dana airline
